# neptune-triton ![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/neptune-triton.svg) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/neptune.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/neptune)

`neptune-triton` is a Futhark implementation of the [Poseidon hash
function](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/), targeting OpenCL for execution on GPU.

`neputne-triton` has undergone a [security audit performed by Troels
Henriksen](neptune-triton-security-audit-report.pdf) and been deemed free of *critical* or *major* security issues.
Incidentally, the linked report contains a detailed analysis of the security guarantees (and their limits) provided by
the [Futhark programming language](https://futhark-lang.org/) itself — many of which flow from its status as a purely
functional programming language.

This repository contains two packages: `neptune-triton-generator` and `neptune-triton`. The former is a code generator,
and the latter is the resulting Rust library.

The generated `neptune-triton` library is implemented over the Bls12-381 curve. `neptune-triton`'s security levels
(partial round numbers) are hard coded to match those provided by
[`neptune`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune), but the actual round constants used must be provided at
runtime. When `neptune-triton` is [used by
`neptune`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune/blob/master/src/gpu.rs) to provide support for batched hashes
(arities 2, 8, and 11).

Code generation is performed by [`genfut`](https://github.com/erk-/genfut). First OpenCL code is generated by invoking
the Futhark compiler, then Rust bindings are generated using [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).
Finally, a Rust library wrapping the generated bindings is created. The resulting Rust library is
[`neptune-triton`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/tree/master/library/neptune-triton).

## Generating Rust code

In general, users should not need to generate code. This already been performed by the library maintainer, and the
resulting generated code is consumed as-is by downstream dependencies. However, for development purposes, or to verify
the provenance of the generated Rust code, `neptune-triton` can be generated by running `neptune-triton-generator`'s
default [`codegen`
binary](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/blob/183587806295e30f1e6aa6d4e9424e4376e2a65d/library/src/bin/codegen.rs).

NOTE: the following will also generate OpenCL code using Futhark, so you will need to have installed the Futhark
compiler first. Instructions for installing the correct version of Futhark can be found below.

From repository root:
```shell
% cd library
% cargo run
```

This will generate Futhark artifacts for an OpenCL implemented in `library/neptune-triton/lib/`, Rust bindings, and a
Rust library wrapping OpenCL code in
[`…/neptune-triton/`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/tree/master/library/neptune-triton).

You can verify that the existing neptune-triton library indeed represents the result of invoking `genfut` by observing
that regenerating the code does not result in a diff to the repository version. For more detail, see the next section
and the procedure described there.

## Verify Code Generation

Because [Futhark output is deterministic by
design](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#reproducibility), you can easily verify that the OpenCL
artifacts are indeed those generated by compiling `poseidon.fut` with Futhark. Because Futhark does not provide
facilities for I/O and only [emits purely functional and (with small exceptions for profiling and deubgging) side-effect
free programs](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c-api.html#general-guarantees). From the preceding link:
>Calling an entry point, or interacting with Futhark values through the functions listed above, has no system-wide side
>effects, such as writing to the file system, launching processes, or performing network connections. Defects in the
>program or Futhark compiler itself can with high probability result only in the consumption of CPU or GPU resources,
>or a process crash.

To verify that OpenCL artifacts are those generated by Futhark, first check the Futhark version which was used by
inspecting the contents of `library/neptune-triton/futhark-version.txt`. Next, install the reported Futhark version.
Note that if a specific Git commit hash is reported, then this commit must be used when building and installing Futhark
if you wish to verify the correctness of the generated code.

For example, if `futhark-version.txt` contains the folowing, then `neptune-triton` was compiled using [commit 965e8eb of Futhark](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/commits/965e8eb):
```
Futhark 0.16.2
git: HEAD @ 2cd88bd (Wed Jul 15 13:40:14 2020 +0200)
Copyright (C) DIKU, University of Copenhagen, released under the ISC license.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
```

If a specific commit is *not* reported, then `neptune-triton` was built with a released version of Futhark. Binary
release can be downloaded [here](https://futhark-lang.org/releases/).

Once Futhark is installed installed, verify the installation by comparing the version information from your Futhark
version and that in `futhark-version.txt`.

```shell
% futhark --version
```

The text should be identical.

Assuming your Futhark version text exactly matches that included in the `neptune-triton` source you wish to verify, you
can regenerate `lib/a.c`, `lib/a.h` as follows:

From repository root:
```shell
% cd library
% futhark opencl --library -o neptune-triton/lib/a poseidon.fut
```

If you have recompiled `poseidon.fut` from a checkout of the project's Git repository, you should observe:
- The timestamps of
  [`neptune-triton/lib/a.c`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/blob/master/library/neptune-triton/lib/a.c),
  [`neptune-triton/lib/a.h`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/blob/master/library/neptune-triton/lib/a.c),
  and
  [`neptune-triton/lib/a.fut`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/blob/master/library/neptune-triton/lib/a.fut)
  have been udpated to reflect this recompilation.
- The content of the files is unchanged, and `git status` shows that your branch is up do date, if it was before:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

If this is not the case, first ensure you do have a clean checkout as above, then try again. Compiling with the correct
Futhark version should produce new output (observable by timestamp) but no change of content ('nothing to commit,
working treen clean').

### Futhark Version

Although binary Futhark releases do not print the associated commit in response to the version command, the commit from
whose content they are built is well-documented. It can be found in the `commit_id` file of the unpacked binary release.

The current version of `neptune_triton` was generated using Futhark v0.16.2, which was itself built from commit
`2cd88bd1b64c1e7d3aebcfa41c3473be845277b7`. Users who wish to verify the accuracy of the claimed Futhark commit may
check that commit out of the [Futhark repo](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark) and build from source. Regenerating code
with the source-built Futhark should still show no changes from the repository version — except that the commit will
have been added to `futhark-version.txt` as in the example above.


## Verify Generated Code is Safe

From the second paragraph of [4.8 General Guarantees (also linked
above)](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c-api.html#general-guarantees):

> Using the #[unsafe] attribute with in-place updates can result in writes to arbitrary memory locations. A malicious
> program can likely exploit this to obtain arbitrary code execution, just as with any insecure C program. If you must
> run untrusted code, consider using the --safe command line option to instruct the compiler to disable #[unsafe].

You may inspect (or grep)
[`poseidon.fut`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton/blob/master/library/poseidon.fut) to verify that
`#[unsafe]` is not used. To observe this differently, you can compile with the `--safe` option and witness that the
output still remains unchanged (as above).

From repository root:
```shell
% cd library
% futhark opencl --safe --library -o neptune-triton/lib/a poseidon.fut
```

## Code Verification in Continuous Integration

The procedure described above is automatically [performed] as part of `neptune-triton`'s continuous integration test
suite. If CI is passing, this check has succeeded.

## Verify Futhark Packages

`poseidon.fut` depends on several Futhark packages, the contents of which are committed to the repository. To verify
that the provided sources correspond to those specified in `library/futhark.pkg`, you can manually sync.

From repository root:
```shell
% cd library
% futhark pkg sync
```

Assuming you have a network connection, there should be no output, and no files in the repository should have been
modified. The Futhark packages will (still) be installed in `library/lib`.
